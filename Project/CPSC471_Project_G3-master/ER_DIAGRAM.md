#####


1. This is a revised edition of the work submitted on Oct 11, 2019.

2. The reason why we created UCALGARY_MEMBER as an entity type is because it helps us validate all guests during account registration and makes sure they are members of UCalgary. In real world, such policy may be implemented by using a set of APIs provided by UCalgary.

3. The entity type 'RANK' is removed since we plan to rank by attributes of 'ITEM'.

4. The entity type 'TYPE_OF_GOODS' is removed since we made 'TYPE' as an attribute of 'ITEM'.

5. We created a new weak entity type 'IDEA_LIST'.

6. In order to keep conformity, we change characters to uppercase. Meanwhile, we rename some relationships and entity types to eliminate ambiguity.
